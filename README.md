<h2 align=center>git automator</h2>
<p align=center>
I am writing this project just for fun and in this project I am trying to automate the gate command process.
Automated means the whole process by executing a command and making my program understandable to everyone.
In addition to learning the Python and Docker programming languages, I try to run this project so that it can be both a training for me and a good program, and I can help my team in the future ...
I will continue forward with strength ...
